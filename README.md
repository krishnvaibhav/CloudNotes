- User Login: Registered users can log in securely using their credentials.
- Create Notes: Users can create, edit, and delete their notes.
- Cloud Storage: Notes are stored securely in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas.
- Secure Authentication: Authentication is implemented using bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving notes.
- Express: A backend framework for building the RESTful API.
- React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- bcrypt: A library for hashing user passwords securely.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A token-based authentication mechanism.
